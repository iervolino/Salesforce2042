                 <li><font size="2">The Bachelor of Arts in Educational Studies (K–8 level) is a competency-based program that enables students to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree online. The B.A. in Educational Studies includes content knowledge related to elementary level teaching. It does not include a supervised teaching practicum in a real classroom and therefore does not meet the requirements for initial teacher licensure. This program is for individuals who, for various reasons, want the academic knowledge that relates to teaching, but who cannot or do not want to participate in a supervised classroom practicum and do not expect to be eligible to teach as a result of completing the program. This program consists of four balanced areas of study (domains) and competency-based assessments. (Please Note: Students in undergraduate Math or Science degree programs must complete all degree-specific content, including specific and effective teaching practices, or they will be required to complete content related to elementary level teaching.) </font></li>
                 <li><font size="2">The Master of Arts in Educational Studies (Elementary Education) is a competency-based program that enables students to earn a Master of Arts degree online. The M.A. in Educational Studies includes content knowledge related to elementary-level teaching as well as research, instructional design, and advanced educational psychology competencies. It does not include a supervised teaching practicum in a real classroom and therefore does not meet the requirements for initial teacher licensure. The program is for individuals who, for various reasons, want the academic knowledge that relates to teaching, but who cannot or do not want to participate in a supervised classroom practicum and do not expect to be eligible to teach as a result of completing the program. Once students complete the content and pedagogical knowledge domains of the program, they proceed through the graduate study domains of Research Fundamentals, Instructional Design, and Advanced Educational Psychology. All students complete a capstone project. (Please Note: MAES is for MAT students only. Students in undergraduate licensure programs may not make a program change to MAES.)</font></li>
